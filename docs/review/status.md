# Project Review Status Summary

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31
**Coverage**: T0 - T18 (Base Interface)

## �� Approved Features (Highlights)
- **Security Core**: AES-256-GCM encryption (T5), secure key management (T4), and random IV/path management (T6).
- **Hardening (T16)**: Mandatory app lock on re-entry, independent thumbnail encryption keys, and optimized database configuration (Page Size = 4096).
- **Onboarding & Auth**: Security Onboarding (T14) with PIN setup (SHA-256) and optional biometric authentication.
- **Data Persistence**: Encrypted SQLCipher database (T8) with FTS5. Initial Schema and Seed Data (T9) deployed.
- **Repository Layer**: Type-safe `RecordRepository`, `ImageRepository` (T12), `OCRQueueRepository`, and `SearchRepository` (T17). Automated tag cache synchronization and OCR task management.
- **Image Handling**: WebP compression (T16), basic processing (T10), and Gallery/Camera integration (T11).
- **UI & UX (T16 Overhaul)**: 
  - **Timeline**: Simplified navigation (AppBar-only settings), 4-6 image grid preview, and optimized data loading.
  - **Ingestion**: Streamlined "Capture -> Preview -> Save" flow.
  - **Detail View**: Split-view layout with per-image metadata (Hospital, Date, Tags) support and in-place editing. Fully enhanced Tag Selector with highlighting and drag-sort.
- **Components**: `EventCard` and `SecureImage` (T13.3) for secure in-memory media rendering.

## 🟡 Pending Issues / Technical Debt
- **T10: Physical Wiping**: Reliance on OS file deletion.
- **Phase 2 OCR Integration**: Infrastructure and schema are ready (T17). `IOCRService` base interface and `OCRResult` models are defined (T18.1). Background processing logic and UI layers are pending.

## 🔴 Blockers
- None.

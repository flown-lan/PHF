# Project Review Status Summary

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-30
**Coverage**: T0 - T14

## 🟢 Approved Features (Highlights)
- **Security Core**: AES-256-GCM encryption (T5), secure key management (T4), and random IV/path management (T6).
- **Onboarding & Auth**: Security Onboarding (T14) with PIN setup (SHA-256) and optional biometric authentication.
- **Data Persistence**: Encrypted SQLCipher database (T8) with FTS5. Initial Schema and Seed Data (T9) deployed.
- **Repository Layer**: Type-safe `RecordRepository` and `ImageRepository` (T12) with automated tag cache synchronization.
- **Environment**: Secure sandbox directories (T7).
- **Image Handling**: Basic processing (T10) and Gallery/Camera integration (T11).
- **Domain Modeling**: Robust entities (T2) and clean business interfaces (T3).
- **State Management**: Riverpod scaffold (T13) with Ingestion and Timeline controllers.
- **UI Kit**: 
  - Foundation: `AppTheme` (Teal/Monospace) and atomic security components (T13.1).
  - Structure: Global `CustomTopBar` and `MainFab` (T13.2) with integrated security indicators.
  - Components: `EventCard` and `SecureImage` (T13.3) for secure in-memory media rendering.

## 🟡 Pending Issues / Technical Debt
- **T13: Thumbnail Encryption**: Reusing main image key due to entity schema limitations (Phase 1 Workaround).
- **T10: PNG Fallback**: Currently using PNG instead of WebP. (High Priority for P2)
- **T8: Database Configuration**: Explicitly set `PRAGMA cipher_page_size = 4096`.
- **T10: Physical Wiping**: Reliance on OS file deletion.

## 🔴 Blockers
- None.
